# Sybrand's build of XMonad

Here you can find my configuration, I use [Nix] to build it and the recompile script (used for `xmonad -recompile`) is in [`build`](https://github.com/syberant/xmonad-sybrand/blob/main/build).

The following parts of this config were ~~blatantly stolen from~~ inspired by [splintah's configuration](https://github.com/splintah/xmonad-splintah):
- `flake.nix`
- `derivation.nix`
- `build`
- `xmonad-sybrand.cabal`
- `src/MouseFollowsFocus.hs`
