/*
This is a nix expression to build Emacs and some Emacs packages I like
from source on any distribution where Nix is installed. This will install
all the dependencies from the nixpkgs repository and build the binary files
without interfering with the host distribution.

To build the project, type the following from the current directory:

$ nix-build emacs.nix

To run the newly compiled executable:

$ ./result/bin/emacs
*/
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

let
  myEmacs = pkgs.emacs;
  emacsWithPackages = (pkgs.emacsPackagesGen myEmacs).emacsWithPackages;
in
  emacsWithPackages (epkgs: (with epkgs.melpaStablePackages; [
    magit          # ; Integrate git <C-x g>
    gruvbox-theme  # ; Gruvbox theme
    use-package
  ]) ++ (with epkgs.melpaPackages; [
    evil # Vim keybindings
    evil-org # For org mode
    #undo-tree      # ; <C-x u> to show the undo tree
    #zoom-frm       # ; increase/decrease font size for all buffers %lt;C-x C-+>
  ]) ++ (with epkgs.elpaPackages; [
    auctex         # ; LaTeX mode
    beacon         # ; highlight my cursor when scrolling
    nameless       # ; hide current package name everywhere in elisp code
    org            # ; org mode
  ]) ++ [
    pkgs.notmuch   # From main packages set
  ])
